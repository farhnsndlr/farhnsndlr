## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and curious developer currently diving deep into the world of web development and system design.  
As a student of Information Systems and a lab assistant at LePKom, I constantly seek opportunities to **build**, **experiment**, and **grow** through real-world coding.

Right now, I'm actively exploring and deepening my understanding in the **IT field** — from backend logic, web performance, to mobile development and Linux-based workflows. I believe that consistency and curiosity are key to becoming a better developer every day.
