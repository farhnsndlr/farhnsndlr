## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and curious developer currently diving deep into the world of web development and system design.  
As a student of Information Systems and a lab assistant at LePKom, I constantly seek opportunities to **build**, **experiment**, and **grow** through real-world coding.

When I'm not studying or helping in the lab, you'll find me crafting responsive UIs, optimizing backend logic, or exploring new tools and frameworks to improve my workflow.
